- compute :- called when first page loaded and form submitted
 - depeneds,store
 - compute on non related/related fields
- onchange :- called when onchange defined field val change 
- ORM Methods :-
 - search 
 - search_count self.env['student.student'].search_count([('name', '=', '')])
 - create 
 - write
 - browse	

self.env['student.stu'].search([('id', '=', 1)])
self.env['fcer'].browse(1)

#RETURN TYPES of ORM Methods:- 
 - create() - record set(tuple) 
 - write() -  boolean(TRUE/FALSE)
 - unlink() - boolean(TRUE/FALSE)
 - search() - record set(tuple)
 - search_count() -  int
 - browse() - record set(tuple)
    diff between search() and browse():- 
	- browse() - search only "id" (we can pass multiple id ) ex:- browse([1,2,,3...])
 	- search() - search by any field
 - read() - list of dictionary #which
 - search_read() - list of dictionary
 - copy() - record set(tuple)
	

what to prac today (02/03/2021):-
 - read() - get specific column/field data #  id, name,first_name,address - #.read(['last_name'])
 - search_read() - search by domain/field name and get specified column/field data #([]) # SELECT LAST_NAME FROM STUDENT WHERE FIRST_NAME = "dharmersh" #  .search_read([('FIRST_NAME','=','dharmesh')],["last_name"])
